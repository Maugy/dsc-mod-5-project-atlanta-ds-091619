Can Random Finite Sets (RFS) improve the computational and functional performance over both? -Traditionally, data association has focused on hard-hard or soft-soft association. Hard-soft data fusion has come about much more recently - how can we associate video tracks of tanks to chat logs of intelligence analysts talking about tanks? -Social media by itself represents a massive amount of information. Can we combine it with traditional data sources like SIGINT and MASINT to do even more? These are actual problems that the scientists and researchers in DEFI are working to solve every day.   As a scientist in DEFI, you will work in small to medium groups of researchers and engineers on projects that typically last 1-3 years.

Typical Education &amp; Experience   Typically a Bachelor's Degree and 4 years work experience or equivalent experience   Required Skills and Education    We are looking for scientists with foundations skills in one or more of the following who are interested in learning more:    We use combinatorial optimization to choose which sensor observations are generated by the same objects.   We use Integer Linear Programs (ILPs) to associate measurements optimally, subject to data association constraints (e.g. a measurement can describe at most one target)   Understanding the data that sensors produce is critical to developing data association algorithms. We use data analysis to understand sensor phenomenology including biases, errors, dropouts, etc.  Data analysis also informs us about how detection algorithms operate on radar, electro-optical, and signal data, etc .    Modeling and simulation enables multi-resolution modeling of complex systems: we can run a low-fidelity radar simulation on thousands of targets, or we can run a high-fidelity simulation on a smaller number of targets.    Additionally, M&amp;S allows us to couple our data association algorithms with sensor resource managers and learning algorithms: our data association algorithms estimate the world around us, and task sensors to investigate specific entities.   Probability and statistics provide the foundation for most of our data association algorithms. We use them to formulate statistical models, perform Bayesian inference, and update our understanding of the world.             MUST have Modeling and Simulation experience.     Must have Data Analysis, preferably on Radar and Target aquisition     Must have MATLAB and/or Python experience.

Opportunity:       Technical lead for all data science efforts. The ideal candidate will be 75% scientist and 25% engineer as we're looking for someone who can do both offline and online modeling. Your work will be cutting edge (emerging market) and will have a tremendous impact on the company's ability to deliver novel insights to their customers via predictive modeling of metrics and their relationships.      Role (Key Traits):        Expertise:  Proven ability to tease apart trends from large volumes of data with 4+ years experience working on large-scale analytics systems and creating predictive/ensemble models (previous research/experience in real-time analytics, data telemetry, and/or explainability would be a strong plus)   Academic Foundation:  Strong math and statistical skills. A candidate with prior operations research background who has expanded their skillset into modern machine learning techniques would be very interesting to us!   Startup Attitude:  Able to cope well with ambiguity and has a “founder mentality” in terms of startup scrappiness, sense of urgency, etc. and ability to unblock themselves whenever necessary (e.g., data import, data prep, feature engineering, model evaluation, etc.)   Pragmatism:  Knows when to use build vs using existing tools for the task (e.g., not trying to build a new ML model when a well-understood statistical technique is the best tool to use)       Application Process:   I will contact anyone who looks like a potential match--requesting to schedule a call with you immediately. Once contacted, I'll explain our VC Recruiting model, spend some time getting to know you better, and will discuss various startup opportunities within our portfolio with you as well.     Due to the volume of applicants we typically receive from our job postings, a follow-up email will not be sent until a match is identified with one of our investments.      Greylock Talent:   I am a full-time, salaried employee of Greylock, and there are no fees associated with any of the work I do. My team provides free candidate referrals/introductions to all of our active investments (one of the many services we provide), and I'm always looking to add new people to our network of talent."

In particular, using our unparalleled data, and view into housing markets, to help build a world-class platform for real estate marketplace optimization. In the Zillow Offers product, Zillow buys homes directly from interested homeowners, thereby sparing them the tremendous stress and effort of selling. Instead, we take that upon ourselves by quickly preparing these homes for the market and sell them to buyers. This is a key initiative at Zillow as we aim to define the future of real estate. This product isn’t viable for everyone (yet). When that’s the case, we want to make sure we still help consumers sell their home.

You will lead analytical efforts to develop scalable and methodologically rigorous approaches to performance measurement (e.g., AB testing, incrementality testing), forecasting, and other applications of advanced analytics.  You will serve as a mentor to other Data Scientists on the team and Analysts across the company by leading learning academies and serving as an available resource for all things related to analytics.  You will mature a common language and approach to analyzing and communicating information and insights across teams.

We're looking for a seasoned data scientist.   You have an undergraduate or Master's degree in a quantitative field (e.g. science, engineering, economics, finance, statistics, or similar).  You have 2+ years of work experience involving quantitative data analysis and complex problem solving.  You have complete command of SQL, Excel, and either Python or R, along with some experience with Tableau and/or Mode.

VP of Data Science,DISCO,"Austin, TX, US","DISCO is a legal tech software company. Our objective is to own the legal tech market and become the leader in legal as Salesforce has done in the sales technology space. Given the massive growth of data over the last 20 years, poorly built legal technology products have severely decreased lawyers’ ability to practice the law.  Our fundamental mission includes building a unified technology platform for the practice of law, composed of 7+ products released over the next 10 years. Great technology can solve problems of scale in data, in laws, and in business operations that have distracted lawyers from doing what they went to law school to do. DISCO is fixing the law by automating the parts of the practice that can be automated so that great lawyers can focus on tasks that really do require human legal judgment.  To date, we have substantially disrupted the legal tech market with a lawyer inspired consumer-grade interface and a cloud-enabled technology platform that offers unprecedented performance and cost savings. Thoughtful product planning and product design are core tenets in our “product first” business strategy and culture.  We intend to build a multi-billion dollar business and think you should come along for the ride because:    DISCO is a very successful company more than doubling revenue every year for the last 5 years. We were the first movers to a cloud-based platform that has caused mass disruption within our market.   Our CEO is a true market visionary. He graduated with a computer science degree at the age of 15 and followed with a JD from Harvard Law School at the age of 19. His unparalleled insights into the fundamental issues in legal and the potential of technology and artificial intelligence to change our market at its core provide the guiding light for DISCO’s long-term strategy.   We believe that product delivery professionals including product managers, product designers and engineers differ from one another by at least a  factor of 10 . At DISCO, we only hire the top 1%, pay them well, and with equity, everyone has effectively been getting a raise each and every day. Given our product-first mindset, product professionals are very much stars of the show. Our logo, the circle and square, represents the best lawyers and the best product professionals in the world.   We measure product delivery velocity by dollars of revenue per line of code, vs simply lines of code. This drives a very thoughtful and deliberate product design and development process that ensures we’re going to make money when we ship products. We hire many more product managers and designers per engineer than most companies to ensure that our engineers have a disambiguated product intent when they are building.   As a rule, we don’t commit to external product delivery dates as we believe that unnecessarily constrains our creativity from both a product and technology point of view.   At DISCO respect isn’t earned at DISCO it is assumed. Good humans inherently treat everyone respectfully. This is a very important concept at DISCO.   Given the high level of talent at DISCO, the cutting-edge cloud-based technology stack, and thoughtful and novel product and design approach, you’ll find yourself learning at a rate you’ve not likely experienced in your career. Given that we only hire professionals that are passionate about their craft, you’ll truly enjoy building a great software product and get in the best “career shape” of your life.   Over the next 4 years, we’ll be growing our product delivery organization from 85 professionals to 500+. There will be incredible growth opportunities along the way.   We use the “2 Pizza Team” organization design where small autonomous teams own a piece of a product or platform and ship software at rates comparable to a very lean and scrappy startup. We achieve consistency across these teams in the areas of design, product-wide use cases and technical concerns through a strategically focused set of overlay functions.   Finally, while we’re an incredibly fast growing organization and, as a rule, we do not work crazy long hours. We believe in continuous product delivery, continuous product planning and design, continuous regular sleep schedules, continuous regular vacation, and continuous fun if you’re passionate about your craft.    If you want to win while getting better than you’ve ever been, come to DISCO.
