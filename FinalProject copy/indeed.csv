Data Analyst,KIPP Foundation,"Chicago, IL 60602","[        Use your data management and analysis skills to ensure educational equality and equity!      KIPP Chicago seeks a full-time Data Analyst for our Regional Data Team. This position is based in Chicago, IL and is available immediately.     Who We Are      KIPP Chicago Schools is a local network of 8 charter schools that is part of the nationally renowned Knowledge Is Power Program (KIPP). Our schools are completely free, and there are no requirements for enrollment except residency in the city of Chicago. Students and families choose to enroll in our schools because they perceive them as the highest quality option in their neighborhoods. Currently we serve 3,000 students in grades K - 8 across 8 campuses.      Our mission is to empower those students with character and academic skills necessary to succeed in top-quality high schools and universities, to be happy in the competitive world, and to have a positive impact on their communities. 99% of our students are African American or Latino; 96% qualify for free and reduced price lunch; and, 16% are identified as diverse learners. In Chicago our campuses are located on the south and west sides of the city, KIPP Chicago alumni from these communities graduate high school at a rate of 90%, matriculate to college at a rate of 87%, and earn a four-year degree at a rate of 36%, compared to national averages of 72%, 45%, and 12%, for “low income” students. In addition to rigorous instruction in our K - 8 classrooms, our students receive continued support in high school and college through our KIPP Through College program and counselors.      The KIPP Chicago Data Team serves as an internal advisory function, supporting schools and regional teams (academic, operations, talent, and alumni support) with analysis, prediction, and data systems support. The Data team’s work runs the gamut from performing ad hoc analyses and decision support for regional leaders to building applications to support school-level decision making. Most of our work uses the R programming language and Google Cloud Platform products, though you’ll see Python, SQL, and Stan in use and in production.     What You’ll Do      Your biggest priority will be ensuring that the data systems that support teaching and learning in our schools operate efficiently as well as analyzing the data these systems collect and generate. This may mean troubleshooting with school operations staff or analyzing data with our data team. No day is typical, but there are cycles throughout the year. There is systems turn-over, set-up, and rostering at the start of the school year. In the middle of the year are interim assessments and pilots of new technology. The end of the year sees many compliance and data reconciliation tasks come to the fore. At times there might be an “all-hands-on-deck” research task to help with a new priority. Nevertheless, you would be expected to oversee the following in this role:      Data Analysis       Perform analyses of student performance and school operations data       Support regional compliance efforts by exporting and analyzing data from our data warehouse as well as other data systems       Ensure data integrity across systems, as well as develop and document best practices in data storage and management.       Working reproducibly (using literate programming practics like Rmd/Jupyter Notebooks as well as version control via Git/GitHub) so colleagues can support and extend your work        Data Systems Management       Working with Analytics Director to manage, maintain, and optimize our three major student data tracking systems: PowerSchool, DeansList, and Illuminate       Support school leaders, teachers, and school staff in troubleshooting issues with ed tech systems       Integrate student information system student rosters with educational technology rosters and maintain rostering systems (like Clever)       Compiling data from web-based applications       Support troubleshooting of student information systems        Professional Development       Learn to use modern data analytical tools (R, Shiny, Stan, Google BigQuery, SQL, Python)       Develop and deliver professional development regarding data use and analysis at periodic, region-wide Collaboration Days (4 each school year).        What you bring      A passion for getting better at analyzing data, optimizing systems, improving process, and growing as data professional.     It’s rare that anyone comes in with across-the-board mastery, and you should plan on intentionally growing your skills while here to fill out your toolkit. You’ve probably taught yourself to use spreadsheet techniques like vlookups, conditional statements, pivot tables, or even index-matching. You’ve maybe dabbled with using databases to do lightweight analyses. Ideally you have some experience with R or Python, but that’s not required. Perhaps you’ve kicked the tires on Tableau or Qlik. You’ve almost assuredly wondered, “there’s got to be a better way to do this tedious task!” and started researching solutions yourself.      Superlative attention to detail.     Our work supports ensuring children from historically underserved communities are provided a high quality education and the means to go to and through college. Our team’s work is mediated by hardworking teachers who directly support our students. Those teacher’s’ decisions on what is best for each child rest on the bedrock of our systems and analyses. We’ll count on you to surface and resolve issues along the way, as the integrity of our final analysis and products must be unquestionable.      A healthy sense of skepticism . . .     You’ll evaluate the relative merits of different approaches, hold the line on what we can conclude when information is limited, and ensure your time is being spent in the right places.      . . . balanced by practical optimism.     We move quickly. In our work, it’s often the case systems changes are necessary to drive organizational improvements; our team must be comfortable with quickly switching course while maintaining systems and data integrity.     Qualifications     Good data sense / numeracy: you notice when the Ns don’t look right and realize the implications of using a weighted mean vs. a straight average of subgroup averages. Even more you know why we often prefer the median      You should have some proficiency with these technical skills, although the right candidate can pick up the others on the job:       Using R (preferred), Python, or similar data analysis languages to process, describe, visualize, analyze, and model disparate data sets       Using spreadsheet or database software to analyze and interpret data       Reconciling data from disparate sources and systems       Some experience writing simple processing scripts       Pulling data from web-based applications       Working reproducibly (so that colleagues can follow and extend your work)       Performing and interpreting basic data analysis (change of time, aggregation)        Strong written and oral communication skills: you share the appropriate amount, at the appropriate level for the audience, in a clear and compelling way.      Ability to work efficiently amidst competing priorities.      Comfort with receiving and sharing constructive feedback.      Curiosity about topics in K-12 education. It helps if you have a background in education (preferred). It’s okay if you don’t, but you should be excited to quickly immerse yourself (we find it’s hard to do good analysis without understanding the context).      What We Offer      KIPP Chicago offers a competitive salary commensurate with experience in a similar position with the potential for an annual performance based bonus. We offer a comprehensive benefits plan, covering the majority of the employee premium for the base medical plan and subsidizing the majority of costs for a spouse/domestic partner and children.

All our vehicles are inspected and reconditioned based on our 150-point certification checklist and come with a 7-day return policy.

The team combines world-leading neuroscientists and business executives with experience commercializing products for the brain.  There currently is no objective way to diagnose psychiatric illness, nor to identify which treatment is best for an individual patient. Treatment selection is presently done by trial-and-error as there are no reliable blood tests nor objective brain measures, for example, that can inform these decisions. This results in clinical care that is highly inefficient and costly. Alto is focused on addressing this need through finding novel brain biomarkers that can define actionable subtypes of psychiatric illnesses, or inform the development and deployment of new treatments. To that end, we are building a platform capable of identifying a pipeline of new brain-based candidate biomarkers that can underpin new product opportunities.
